# Day 1: Historian Hysteria

## Part 1

Two lists, side by side, get the sum of the differences of the pairs.
Simple enough.

## Part 2

The input is two lists of numbers, side by side.
For each value N(i) in the left list, get the count of that value in the right list.
Then M(i) = that count multiplied by the value N.
Sum for all M(i).

Minor hiccup when using hashmaps, and the value isn't found.
