# Day 3: Mull It Over

## Part 1

Look for all the "mul(<A>,<B>)", and return the sum of all the A*B.

Learned how to use the regex crate.

## Part 2

Same as part one but also look for "do()" and "don't()", which turns on and off the "mul" function.

Learned that I don't really understand the regex crate.

## ChatGPT

Solved both parts without issue.
