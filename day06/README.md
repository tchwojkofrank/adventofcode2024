## Intro

A map with obstacles, and a guard walking in straight lines, turning at obstacles.

## Part 1

Figure out the guard's path and return the number of squares they visit.
I just simulated all the steps.

## Part 2

Figure out at which locations adding an obstacle will result in a loop.
I just tried putting an obstacle at each position in the original path.
